# Notify - Cross-platform Mobile Application

![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Xamarin-blue)

## Description

Notify is a unique social reminder app that utilizes dynamic location-based reminders. With Notify, users can set personalized "smart" reminders based on time and/or location, both on their device and for other users. The app's registration process is phone number-based, sending an SMS containing a verification code to the number used for registration.

## Features

- Set reminders for:
    - Personal use.
    - Other users defined as friends in the app.
    - Predefined groups.
- Reminder types:
    - Static location.
    - Type of location (e.g., supermarket, ATM, pharmacy).
    - Time.
    - WiFi - Upon connection/disconnection.
    - Bluetooth - Upon connection/disconnection.

Location type reminders allow users to choose a type of location and a distance from the location, receiving a notification when they are within the defined distance from the location. For example, a user who needs to withdraw cash could set a reminder for 50 meters from an ATM, receiving a notification on their device along with the location of the nearby ATM when they come within 50 meters of any ATM.
